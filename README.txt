    Timeline:
        ----Part 1----
        We had a week for this project (5 work day).
        Day 1:
            Andy is working on scrapping the links from the Immoweb search pages with selenium.
            Cyril is working on getting the data from a Immoweb property page.
            Ibrahim is sick.
        Day 2:
            Andy is finishing the scrapper for the links.
            Cyril is still collecting data and has started to clean them a bit.
            Ibrahim is cleaning data and reading the work from the previous day.
        Day 3:
            Andy has finished the scrapper for links and got 68k links in a csv file. He started to work on multi-threading the task.
            Cyril has finished cleaning the data and put the final data in a csv file.
            Ibrahim helped clean the data.
        Day 4:
            Andy is documenting his functions and writing the Readme.
            Cyril is documenting his functions.
            The project is finished.
        Day 5:
            Imporving the code and cheeking for bugs

        ----Part 2----
        I (Andy Gilet) had seven days for this part of the project
        Day 1:
            Hum, ok let's look at what the others have done.
            one hour later - WTF ?
        Day 2:
            Still working on redoing what Cyril has done. Why can't he comment his code correctly and make smaller functions !
        Day 3:
            This night, I had a dream. I was strangling Cyril in his sleep. What a sweet dream.
            After a day of working in this mess, I've decided to say that his code and the data he put together was ok and start working on it the day after.
        Day 4:
            I searched and created two new data set for the demography in belgium and the crime rates.
            I'm poundering if I should make a database online to had complexity to the project.
        Day 5:
            Still working on the dataFrame for the plots.
        Day 6:
            The dataframes for the plots are finished and the plots are finished to.
            I still have to make small adjustments to make them more readable.
        Day 7:
            I put my plots on the presentation, comments my functions, and updated the readme

    Personnal situation:
        ----Part 1----
        Andy Gilet:
            I did not encounter any problems

        Cyril Verwimp:
            I made the data_analyse and cleaning part ! Ibrahim helped me with the cleaning !
            The project was really intersting and challenging ! And I liked it a lot

        Ibrahim Mettioui:
           I struggle with the scrapping but thanks to Andy and Cyril for helping me to clarify and to contribute to the project
        ----Part 2----
        Andy Gilet:
            It took me a bit of time because I was a bit obsessed with redoing a part of Cyril work I had a bit of a struggle to understand.
            After 3 days of frustration, I said screw it and decided that the dataset Cyril put together was probably ok and start my project from that point.
